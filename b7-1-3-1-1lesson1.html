                        <p>
                            Let us first understand what fractions are.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Assume your mother gave you an orange to share with your 2 siblings. You may then decide
                            to use a knife to slice the orange into 3 equal parts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each sibling will get one (1) part out of the three (3) equal parts that you sliced with the 
                            knife.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We say that each part of the sliced orange has a fraction of \(\frac{1}{3}\), that is, one 
                            out of three.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>A fraction is defined as a part of a whole.</strong> 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The orange was one whole (that is, \(1\)), until you sliced it into the various parts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Below are some examples of fractions.
                        </p>

                        <br><br>
                        <hr>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>
                            Fractions are usually written in the form \(\frac{a}{b}\).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \(* \hspace{0.5cm}\)\(\frac{a}{b} \Rightarrow\) You say, \(\mathbf{a}\) over \(\mathbf{b}\), or \(\mathbf{a}\) out
                        of \(\mathbf{b}\). You can also simply say, \(\mathbf{a}\) divided by \(\mathbf{b}\).
                        </p>
                        
                        <br>

                        <p>
                            Given any fraction, say \(\frac{a}{b}\), the top part (\(\mathbf{a}\)) is called the <strong>numerator</strong> while
                            the bottom part (\(\mathbf{b}\)) is called the <strong>denominator</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When you divide the numerator by the denominator, the value that you obtain is called <strong>a quotient.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We will learn more about these definitions in a later lesson.
                        </p>

                        <br><br>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Remember:</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \[\frac{a}{0} = undefined\]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That is, any number divided by zero (0) does not exist in the set of real numbers, hence the denominator of fractions
                            should not be zero (0).
                        </p>

                        <h3>Types of Fractions</h3><br>

                        <p>
                            Let's now look at the types of fractions that we have.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <strong> 1. Common (Proper) Fractions</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Common fractions are fractions whose numerator is smaller (or less) than the denominator. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Examples of common fractions are \(\frac{1}{2}\), \(\frac{1}{3}\), \(\frac{1}{4}\),\(\frac{1}{5}\), etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Common fractions usually take their names from the number of parts that the whole is divided into. So for instance:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \(*\) \(\frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow\) is usually called one-half
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \(*\) \(\frac{2}{3} \Rightarrow\) is usually called two-third
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \(*\) \(\frac{1}{4} \Rightarrow\) is usually called one-fourth
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And so on.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Common fractions are sometimes called proper fractions.
                        </p> <br>


                        <p>
                           <strong> 2. Improper Fractions</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Improper fractions on the other hand are fractions whose numerators are larger (or bigger) than their denominators.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Examples of improper fractions are as follows:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \(*\) \(\frac{12}{5} \Rightarrow\) you say, twelve divided by five, or twelve over five.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \(*\) \(\frac{22}{7} \Rightarrow\) you say, twenty-two divided by seven, or twenty-two over seven.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \(*\) \(\frac{13}{12}\)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You are required to learn how to change improper fractions to mixed fractions.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p>
                            <strong>3. Mixed Fractions</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mixed fractions are fractions which include a combination of a whole number and a proper fraction (or common fraction).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Examples of mixed fractions are as follows:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \(*\) \(2\frac{2}{5} \Rightarrow\) which is the mixed fraction you get when you convert \(\frac{12}{5}\).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \(\hspace{0.5cm}\)You say, two whole number, two over five.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \(*\) \(3\frac{1}{7} \Rightarrow\) which is the mixed fraction you get when you convert \(\frac{22}{7}\)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \(\hspace{0.5cm}\) You say, three whole number, one over seven.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \(*\) \(1\frac{1}{12} \Rightarrow\) which is the mixed fraction you get when you convert \(\frac{13}{12}\)
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            We will learn in a later lesson, how to change an improper fraction to a mixed fraction, and vice versa.
                            In Mathematics, it is always a good practice to change improper fractions to mixed fractions.

                            The second diagram (Diagram B) is also a whole (1) divided into 4 equal parts. Each part as a fraction is written
                            as \(\frac{1}{4}\), that is one out of four. Hence, when two parts are shaded, the shaded (coloured) part is 
                            two out of four (that is \(\frac{2}{4}\)).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It can therefore be deduced from the two figures above that:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \[\frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4}\]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These two fractions are called <strong>equivalent fractions.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <u>Equivalent fractions</u> are fractions which have the same value but different numerators and denominators.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Examples of other equivalent fractions to \(\frac{1}{2}\) are as follows:

                        <h3>Finding Equivalent Fractions</h3><br>

                        <p>
                            In Mathematics, any number multiplied by one (1) will give the number itself. <br> 
                            Example:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \(\frac{1}{2} \times 1 = \frac{1}{2}\)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also, any number divided by itself will give us one (1).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \(*\) \(\frac{2}{2} = 1 \)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \(*\) \(\frac{3}{3} = 1 \)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \(*\) \(\frac{4}{4} = 1 \)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To find the equivalent fractions of any given fraction, you will need to express the number one (1) as any number 
                            divided by itself (as above), and multiply it to the given fraction. The resulting fraction becomes the equivalent
                            fraction of the fraction originally given.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Consider the example below:
                        </p>

                        <h3>Example 1</h3> <br>

                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                        <p>
                            Fraction given \(\Rightarrow \frac{2}{3}\)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \(1 = \frac{2}{2} = \frac{3}{3} =\frac{4}{4}\)
                        </p>

                            Equivalent fractions:

                        <p>
                            \(\Rightarrow \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{2}{2} = \mathbf{\frac{4}{6}}\)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \(\Rightarrow \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{3}{3} = \mathbf{\frac{6}{9}}\)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \(\Rightarrow \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{4}{4} = \mathbf{\frac{8}{12}}\)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \(\therefore\) 3 equivalent ratios to \(\frac{2}{3}\) are \(\mathbf{\frac{4}{6}}, \mathbf{\frac{6}{9}}\) and

                        <p>
                            When solving questions in Mathematics, it is always best practice to leave fractions in their simplest form.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Let's now learn how to express fractions in their lowest term.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To express fractions in their simplest form. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            1. You can first express the numerator and denominator as a product of their HCF (Highest Common Factor) 
                            and another number.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For instance, in expressing \(\frac{8}{12}\) in its simplest form, we have:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \(\frac{8}{12} = \frac{2 \times 4}{3 \times 4}\)
                        </p> <br>
                        <p>
                            2. We can rewrite the equation above in a different form as shown below:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \(\frac{8}{12} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{4}{4}\)
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Remember</strong> that, <br>
                            Any number divided by itself gives one. That is \(\frac{4}{4} = 1\)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \(\Rightarrow \frac{8}{12} = \frac{2}{3} \times 1\)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \(\therefore \frac{8}{12} = \frac{2}{3}\)
                        </p>

                        <br><br>
                        <hr>
                        <br><br>

                        <p>
                            You can also say that, since the HCF is found at the numerator side and again at the denominator side, it 
                            will cancel itselt out. As shown in the image below:
