    // Each level would have 20 questions

// Note: In a complete implementation, there would be 140 questions (20 per level x 7 levels)
// The questions would increase in difficulty with each level, covering more specific
// aspects of wildlife utilization, conservation strategies, biodiversity measurements,
// international conventions, and case studies from the provided course materials.
