                        <p>
                            In Mathematics, the gradient of a line is indicated with the letter <strong>m</strong>.
                            It is simply a measure of how steep the line is.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A real life example is when you are considering two mountains to climb. If one mountain is 
                            steeper than the other, it means that the steeper mountain is more difficult to climb than the 
                            less steep one.
                        </p>
                        <!--Put a diagram here possibly to give more description -->
                        <p>
                            The aim of this lesson is to learn how to calculate the gradient of a line and use
                            the knowledge gained to find the equation of a line in our next lesson.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since gradient is a measure of how steep a line is, the best place to start our
                            lesson is the cartesian plane.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the cartesian plane, in order to draw a line, you will need either one of these:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <li>Two (2) points (coordinates), or</li> 
                            <li>A coordinate and a gradient.</li>
                        </p>
                        <!--Put a diagram with regards to the gradient here to help the learner to understand-->
                        <p>
                            When two (2) lines are located on the cartesian plane, the gradient of the line is 
                            given as below:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           \[Gradient, m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\] 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \(y\)<sub>2</sub> \(-\) \(y\)<sub>1</sub> \(\Rightarrow\) the change or difference in the \(y\) 
                            components of the two points or coordinates given, and
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \(x\)<sub>2</sub> \(-\) \(x\)<sub>1</sub> \(\Rightarrow\) the change or difference in the \(x\) 
                            components of the two points or coordinates given.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This implies that:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \[Gradient, m = \frac{Change \ in \ y}{Change \ in \ x}\] 
                        </p>

                        <h3>THE GRADIENT WHEN THE EQUATION OF THE LINE IS GIVEN</h3>

                        <p>
                            Sometimes you will be given the equation of the line for you to find the gradient.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The equation of a line is always written in the form:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \[y = mx + c\]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When the equation is written in this form, the gradient \(m\) is the coefficient of
                            \(x\) and the \(c\) in the equation is called the <strong>y-intercept</strong>, that is,
                            the point where the line cuts the \(y-axis\).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          <li>\(m \Rightarrow\) the  gradient of the line</li>  
                          <li>\(c \Rightarrow\) the y-intercept</li>
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            If the equation of the line is not given in this form, you will need to make y the subject
                            of the equation in order to find your gradient.
                        </p>

                            In Basic 7, we learnt about the rule of a relation. For instance, consider the ordered pairs
                            below:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \((1, 3), (2, 5), (3, 7), (4, 9), (5, 10)\)
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            You would say that the rule of the relation is "the sum of twice \(x\) and 1", or "Two times \(x\) 
                            added to 1," in words, and in algebra:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            \[y = 2x + 1\]
                        </p>
